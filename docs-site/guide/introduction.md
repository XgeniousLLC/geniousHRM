## What is GeniusHRM?

GeniusHRM is a **Laravel 13 + React 18 + TypeScript** web application that covers the full employee lifecycle — from recruitment and onboarding through performance management, payroll, and offboarding. It is built with a modular architecture using `nwidart/laravel-modules`, meaning each functional area (Employees, Payroll, Attendance, etc.) is an independent Laravel module that can be enabled, disabled, or extended without touching core code.

The system ships with **demo data seeders**, so you can evaluate every feature immediately after installation without manual data entry.

## Architecture Overview

GeniusHRM follows a **modular monolith** pattern. All feature code lives inside `Modules/` — each module contains its own:

```
Modules/
  Employees/
    Config/
    Database/
      Migrations/
      Seeders/
    Http/
      Controllers/
      Requests/
      Resources/
    Models/
    Providers/
    Routes/
    resources/
      js/
        Pages/
        Components/
```

The React frontend communicates with Laravel via **Inertia.js** — no separate API server is needed for the UI. A dedicated RESTful JSON API layer (`/api/v1/`) is available for mobile apps or third-party integrations, secured via **Laravel Sanctum** Bearer tokens.
